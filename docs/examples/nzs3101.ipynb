    "## NZSEE Probable Strength Analyses\n",
    "The ``NZS3101`` design code also allows for the analysis of concrete cross-sections in accordance with the NZSEE C5 Assessment Guideline provisions.\n",

    "These guidelines are intended for the assessment of existing structures based on probable material strength assumptions for the steel and concrete materials. The probable strength of materials is intended to represent more of an average strength approach, recognising that in the real world structures the material strengths are less likely to all be measured to be 5% characteristic strength value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To utilise these types of analyses within ``ultimate_bending_capacity()``, ``moment_interaction_diagram()`` and ``biaxial_bending_diagram()`` methods we can specify an ``analysis_type`` of ``prob_chk`` or ``prob_os_chk`` to undertake a normal or overstrength probable strength based analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can specify predefined probable strength steel materials that are based on common historic material probable strength properties from the NZSEE C5 guidelines, or we can specify a steel material based on characteristic properties and the analysis will internally scale these to appropriate probable strength-based material properties. Similarly, concrete strengths are specified based on characteristic strengths and are internally scaled to the appropriate probable strength-based concrete material when a probable strength based ``analysis_type`` is specified.\n",

    "## Moment-Curvature Analysis\n",
    "Note we will undertake a moment-curvature analysis based on an unconfined probable strength based analysis to the NZSEE C5 assessment guidelines.\n",

    "The section we will analyse will be a 600D x 400W beam section with 5-D28 grade 275 bars top and bottom, and D10 stirrups with 30 cover and an original specified characteristic concrete strength of 25 MPa.\n",
    "\n",
    "We utilise these parameters to create a new concrete cross-section with a predefined steel material with probable strength properties and a characteristic concrete strength properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the results to be valid we need to utilise a stress/strain model for the concrete that accurately reflects the behaviour of the concrete. The NZSEE C5 Assessment Guidelines utilised a modified Mander concrete model for this purpose for moment-curvature analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note it may not be appropriate to utilise a concrete stress/strain relationship that was deemed suitable for an analysis to determine the ultimate capacity of a concrete cross section as these typically do not model the degradation of the concrete strength at higher strains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for a moment-curvature analysis to NZSEE C5 assessment guidelines, we can utilise a higher ultimate concrete strain of $\\varepsilon_{c,max}$ = 0.004 for an unconfined analysis. Note also for a moment-curvature analysis to the NZSEE C5 assessment guidelines that the limiting strain in the reinforcement is taken as $\\varepsilon_{c,max}$ = 0.6 $\\varepsilon_{cu}$ but $\\leq$ 0.06 (or 6% strain). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note if the section can be classified as being confined, the concrete limiting strain can be even higher leading to increased ductility of the cross-section (refer to NZSEE C5 assessment guidelines for further discussion). However, for a confined analysis the section is typically analysed assuming the cover concrete has spalled as the cover concrete is unconfined (so a concrete section corresponding to this particular scenario would need to be created if a confined concrete stress-strain relationship ws being utilised).\n",

    "This calculated ratio shows that the NZSEE assessment guidelines formulas have slightly underestimated the maximum curvature obtained when compared with that from the moment-curvature analysis. This highlights the importance of undertaking a moment-curvature analyses to capture the behaviour of the concrete cross-section, rather than placing sole reliance on empirical formulas."
